## Assignment

Design a backend architecture and write code, with two APIâ€™s (Signup, Login) with MongoDB as database and implementing following conditions: 
1. Regular username and password validation: check username and password is matching or not
2. Barring every 5th login: From platform point of view, across all the users, block every 5th login. 
3. There should be a 3rd party service which responds with 'true' or 'false'. This should not be an API - request response cycle but using queuing mechanism.

## Project Requirements
1. Nodejs
2. RabbitMQ
3. MongoDB

## Project Setup
1. Run `$ npm install` in the root folder to download all dependencies of API project.
2. Run `$ npm install` in the "/ThirdPartyService" folder to download dependencies for Third party service project.
3. Run `$ npm start` in both projects to start the application and service.
